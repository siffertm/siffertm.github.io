# Hi, I’m Maxime 👋

> “Learning how to hack things, so I can help fix them (or at least understand why they broke).”

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast on a mission to:
- 📜 Pass the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Network+, Security+)
- 🧪 Build & break things in my home lab
- 🥇 Compete in CTFs
- 🤝 Attend events & network to find my niche

---

## 🛠 My Current Toolkit
- **Languages**: C & Python  
- **Platforms**: macOS & Linux (daily drivers)
- **Approach**: Hands-on, "learn-by-doing" in everything I work on

---

## 📚 More Than Just Code
- I love sport—but only if it has a purpose (no endless reps!)
- I'm a voracious reader and an intense tinker-er
- I ask *way too many questions*—especially when it comes to how things work

---

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next
- 🔍 A showcase of home lab projects
- 🧠 Write-ups from CTF challenges and security research
- 🗣 Event recaps and maybe even blog posts about my cybersecurity journey

## 📬 Let’s Connect
If you’re into cybersecurity, learning new things, or just want to geek out: drop me a line!

*This README will grow as I do—so don’t be surprised if new sections pop up soon*
