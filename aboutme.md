title: About me
---

I believe that cybersecurity isn't just about technology. It's about people.

After years of training and competing at national and international levels in different sports, and diving deep into psychology to understand human behavior, I discovered something crucial: the weakest link in any security system isn't the code or the hardware. It's us.

That realization is now driving my transition into cybersecurity.

## My Journey

My path toward becoming a Human Firewall expert wasn't traditional. I started in sports, where discipline and mental resilience were everything. The pressure of competing at high levels taught me how people react under stress, how they make decisions when everything is on the line, and most importantly, how to train minds to perform when it matters most.

Psychology became my next focus. I needed to understand why people do what they do, how they think, and what drives their choices. This knowledge led me to coaching at 42 Berlin, one of Europe's most demanding tech schools. There, I helped students navigate intense technical training while managing stress, building discipline, and maintaining their mental health.

It was at 42 Berlin that I discovered my calling. After being a student myself, I started to work there and lead the cybersecurity section. I realized that all the firewalls, encryption, and security protocols in the world mean nothing if the humans using them aren't prepared. I started organizing corporate talks, delivering workshops, and training both students and professionals on the human side of security.

Now I'm deepening my technical foundation through the CompTIA certification track, starting with A+ Core 1. Every concept I learn reinforces what I already knew: technology serves people, but people make the security decisions.

## What I'm Building

I'm developing expertise that combines:
- **Sports psychology principles** to build mental resilience against social engineering
- **Behavioral understanding** to predict and prevent human security failures  
- **Growing technical knowledge** to ground psychological insights in real-world systems
- **Coaching experience** to create lasting behavioral change

## Why This Matters Now

Through my certifications training (a+, network+, security+), I'm seeing how every technical concept connects to human behavior. Hardware failures teach us about single points of failure in decision making. Network protocols show us how trust gets established and broken. System administration reveals how small oversights become major vulnerabilities.

Cybercriminals already understand human psychology. They know we're more likely to click suspicious links when we're tired, share passwords when we're in a hurry, or trust people who sound confident. They exploit these patterns every day.

But here's what they don't expect: people who understand both the technical landscape AND human psychology. People who can spot manipulation, resist social engineering, and make security decisions automatically, even under pressure.

That's what I'm training to become. And once I get there, that's what I'll teach others to be.

## Let's Connect

Whether you're interested in following my journey from psychology and sports into cybersecurity, want to discuss the human side of security, or are building your own technical foundation, I'd love to connect.

I document my learning process, share insights about how technical concepts relate to human behavior, and explore what it really means to make people the strongest part of any security system.

Because at the end of the day, you are your own best firewall. I'm learning how to help you use that power.
