subtitle: Learning how to hack things, so I can help fix them.
---

I started in education and eventually found my way into tech — not because I was chasing buzzwords, but because I really like understanding how things work.

Right now, I’m on a mission:
✓ Pass the CompTIA trifecta (A+, Network+, Security+)  
✓ Build and break stuff in my home lab  
✓ Sharpen my skills through CTFs  
✓ Attend events and meet people to find my cybersecurity niche

Outside of tech, I love sports — but the kind with a goal, not endless reps just for the sake of it. Same with learning: I prefer meaningful exploration over rote exercises. I also read a lot and ask way too many questions about how everything works.

If you're into tech, security, or just curious minds — you’re in the right place.
